# deCDN

deCDN intercepts common JavaScript libraries, stylesheets, and fonts typically hosted on Content Delivery Networks and provides a local copy. This helps reduce bandwidth and prevents CDNs from tracking your activity across websites.  
The exact list of entries is pulled from [LocalCDN's repository](//codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN), so check there for a full list.

#### Supports
